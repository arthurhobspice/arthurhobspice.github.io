I used to train Unix (Sun Solaris, actually) for three years at Sun Microsystems, being an
instructor for customer and train-the-trainer classes.
Later on, since I was having this experience, I was repeatedly asked to hold Unix training sessions
for my colleagues. For these trainings I compiled some presentation and exercise material.
Feel free to take a look and use.
