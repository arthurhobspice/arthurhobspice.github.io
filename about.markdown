# Who I am

I am an IT allrounder with more than 20 years of IT experience, specialised in requirements engineering, solution development
and implementation as well as IT operations, with broad telecommunications business knowledge both in the B2C and B2B area.
My particular areas of expertise are IT training, Unix and Linux, cloud services and Infrastructure as Code, application deployment,
scripting and programming for automation, monitoring and analytics, relational databases and data warehousing as well as
data analytics and reporting. I have supported several big IT transformation projects, and I am experienced in agile working methods
(Scrum, SAFe). My current professional focus areas are cloud infrastructure provisioning, deployment and management of
containerised applications and Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD).
