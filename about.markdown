<img src="/files/CB.jpg" alt="That's me" width="200">

I am a physicist (diploma and PhD) and an IT allrounder with more than 20 years of professional experience.
I have continuously been working with computers of different kinds since the advent of the
Commodore 16 and 64 in the 1980s. I definitely prefer Unix and Linux over Windows, but since Windows 10 I
made my peace with Microsoft's operating system.

My current focus areas are cloud architecture and cloud infrastructure provisioning (mainly on AWS), deployment
and management of containerised applications (Docker, Kubernetes) and Continuous Integration/Continuous
Deployment (CI/CD).

Recently I have started delving into the fascinating area of Quantum Computing.

I was born in 1972 in Wuppertal, in Germany, now I live with my family near the river Rhine between
Düsseldorf and Cologne.

## University

### Diploma (1992-1997)

I studied physics (with mathematics, electronic data processing and artificial intelligence as
subsidiary studies) at the University of Wuppertal. My diploma thesis is about the thermal
behaviour of high-temperature superconductor thin films exposed to high-frequency electromagnetic radiation.
The generation of heat at small non-superconducting defects with normal electrical resistance
may lead to a "quench" of the superconductivity. This unwanted phenomenon
limits the use of superconductors as electronic HF components.
My work was a mixture of laboratory experiments with superconducting thin films and numerical
calculations of their thermal behaviour in high-frequency fields. For the latter I
rewrote and improved existing Fortran 77 programs in C.

During this time I supervised student learning groups in mathematics and experimental
physics.

### Doctoral Degree/PhD (1997-1999)

For my PhD I changed subject and department within the University of Wuppertal and moved
to the theoretical physics division. Our field of study was wetting phenomena, i.e. the
microscopic distribution of liquids, at chemically and geometrically structured interfaces. This is a
sub-area of thermodynamics and statistical physics ("physics of condensed matter"). One of
the practical applications is a "chemical microchip". We compared two different approaches, a
non-local density functional theory and a simplified local interface deformation ("Extended Young-Laplace")
model. The complex integral and differential equations, respectively, cannot be solved exactly
with pen and paper, we had to apply numerical calculations using C and the
Numerical Algorithm Group (NAG) libraries.

At the theoretical physics department I earned my money by managing the department's
Unix workstations and servers, mainly SunOS/Solaris and Digital Unix. This and all
the programming work during diploma and PhD laid the foundation for a lifelong IT career.

## Professional experience

### Sun Microsystems (2000-2003)

At Sun Microsystems (which is now part of Oracle) I worked as an instructor, teaching customers
and other instructors ("train-the-trainer" lessons) all about Unix and Sun's server systems: Unix
fundamentals, scripting, Solaris system administration, server and storage maintenance and
networking. Moreover, I was part of a small group of people developing Sun system administration
certification exams.

### Vodafone (2003-today)

Between 2003 and 2012 I worked in Vodafone's IT Operations unit. My team was responsible for the application
operations of sales, customer care and billing IT systems, in particular the applications used in the
Vodafone stores.

Key achievements in these years were:

- Wrote all deployment, monitoring and data load shell scripts for the
applications used for "fuzzy" customer search, postal address and bank data validation
- Designed and implemented a generic monitoring system, using Perl and
PL/SQL programming
- Created SLA and performance dashboards and real-time map displays of
Vodafone shops' sales activity, using PHP and JavaScript programming
- Wrote operational concepts which were used as the basis for contracts
with IT service providers and SAS70 auditing
- Designed and implemented the IT infrastructure for the first Vodafone
flagship store in collaboration with our shop operations service provider
- Integrated parts of the IT system landscapes of Vodafone and Arcor

In 2012 I moved to a newly founded business unit "Digital Transformation". I was a
business analyst and requirements engineer, my team designed a new shop frontend (technical
and user experience design), relaying between the Retail business and the IT delivery units.

From 2015 to 2018 I worked in B2B Sales Support and (following an internal reorganization) in
B2B Marketing and Customer Value Management as a data analyst. My focus areas were analysis of customer
data and sales KPIs in order to measure and maximise customer value, churn analysis,
churn propensity modelling, analysis and modelling (prediction) of revenues, data selection for campaigns,
creation of ad-hoc analyses, reports and visualizations, and finding
recommendations on sales and customer relationship activities.

Since 2018 I am back in IT, working as a technical manager in the Center of Excellence (CoE) for
CI/CD, Cloud and DevOps. The CoE evolved out of an IT unit originally responsible for deployment, change
and release management, i.e. receiving software deliveries and rolling them out in test and production environments,
as well as the provisioning of data center infrastructure - all of that in a world of legacy applications.
With agile and DevOps methods arising, cloud infrastructure and CI/CD automation techniques
become more and more important, and the CoE's job today is to do research, give guidance and provide
consultancy and design and implementation support in these modern topics.
