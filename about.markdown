I am a physicist (diploma and PhD) and an IT allrounder with more than 20 years of professional experience in
different areas. I have continuously been working with computers of different kinds since the advent of the
Commodore 16 and 64 in the 1980s. I definitely prefer Unix and Linux over Windows, but since Windows 10 I
made my peace with Microsoft's operating system.

My current focus areas are cloud architecture and cloud infrastructure provisioning (mainly on AWS), deployment
and management of containerised applications (Docker, Kubernetes) and Continuous Integration/Continuous
Deployment (CI/CD).

Recently I have started delving into the fascinating area of Quantum Computing.
